## Overview

### The challenge

To build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible both on mobile and desktop screens.

TODO (when React will be implemented):

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
